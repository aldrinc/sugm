<h4><span><strong>Gifts and Goods that are so unique, you'll simply shut-up and gift them!</strong></span></h4>
<p><span><strong>Every month here at Shutupandgiftme we carefully curate amazing, mind-bending, paradigm-shifting goods and gifts...</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We founded Shutupandfgiftme with one simple goal: to provide incredible and intriguing goods that will spark curiosity and inspire creativity - <strong><em>and we truly believe this is crucial to a new way of perceiving the world</em></strong>. </span></p>
<p><span>Shutupandgiftme is different. Instead of offering a huge, unoriginal collection, we carefully select just a few unique pieces perfectly suited for those with wanderlust, just like us. We do this so that you won't have to spend extra time searching for that perfect something. With that said, if you have a recommendation or want to see something specific in our collections, drop us a line and we will see if we can make something beautiful happen.</span></p>

<h4><span>SUPPORT A GREAT CAUSE: IRIDESCENT LEARNING</span></h4>
<p><span>If that wasn't cool enough, a portion of all purchases goes to the education non-profit <a href="https://iridescentlearning.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iridescent</a>, an amazing charity that helps kids become the innovators and leaders of tomorrow. They do this by empowering the world's underrepresented young people, especially girls, through science, engineering and technology entrepreneurship</span> <span>training. We also love that Iridescent engages parents as learners, right alongside their children – a key ingredient for lasting impact not addressed by other STEM educational programs.</span></p>
