The applicable amount will immediately be reserved on your card but will not be debited until the goods are dispatched. Vincent & Bosco reserves the right to check the validity of the credit or debit card, its credit status in relation to the order value and whether the address data of the purchaser is correct. We may refuse orders depending on the result of these checks.<br /> <strong><br /> PayPal<br /> </strong>When paying by PayPal, Vincent & Bosco reserves the right to check the validity of the PayPal account, that there are enough funds to cover the purchase sum and validate the billing address details of the purchaser.

Vincent & Bosco reserves the right to deny any purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Payment after delivery</strong></p>
<p><strong>Invoice - pay within 20 days</strong> <br /> The payment request is sent to your e-mail address when the order is shipped. The statement will show the total amount due including VAT and delivery charges. Payment is due within 20 days after the statement date.</p>
<p><strong>Pay next month</strong> <br /> All items you purchase and receive within one month are included in one statement, which is sent to you the following month. A fee of £1.25 will be added to the amount payable. Payment is due at the end of the month in which the statement is issued.</p>
<p><strong>Credit check</strong> <br /> Vincent & Bosco reserves the right to review your application for "invoice" and/or "pay next month" and to refuse it, limit it, demand an advance payment or suggest an alternative method of payment. We will review your credit history with credit and fraud prevention agencies when you apply for "invoice" and/or "pay next month" with us and, for any significant increase in your credit limit and periodically to manage your account. When a credit reference agency receives a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other organizations. We will also share your personal data with credit reference agencies, fraud prevention agencies and other similar bodies in relation to the use of your account. The charges and rates of interest specified below may be varied from time to time by notice from Vincent & Bosco to you.</p>
<p><strong>Arrears</strong> <br /> You fall into arrears if your statement or instalment account is not paid by the due date. The total amount owed by you to Vincent & Bosco becomes payable immediately, or, in the case of customers paying by instalments, following notice from Vincent & Bosco to that effect. Vincent & Bosco will send you a payment reminder letter requesting payment immediately. If you have still failed to pay the overdue amounts Vincent & Bosco will send you a ”Notice of Default”. We will charge you £7.00 for each payment reminder letter and a further £12.00 for any Notice of Default. Vincent & Bosco reserves the right to charge an annual penalty interest of 17.9 % on the capital sum after due date if you choose "Pay next month" and an annual penalty interest of 17.9 % on the capital sum if you choose to pay in instalments. We will apply payments against the current debt in the following order: costs, interest and then capital sum. You always have a right to pay all or part of your instalment debt prior to a scheduled payment date.</p>
<p><strong>Others</strong> <br /> Please note that Vincent & Bosco reserves the right to send payment requests to your e-mail address.</p>
<p>Please note that we do not accept cash or cheques. If you wish to pay by cash/cheque please pay at your bank or a Barclays bank using your payment slip. Vincent & Bosco reserves the right to charge £15 for costs arising for any cash/cheques received.</p>
