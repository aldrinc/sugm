We will provide a refund attempting to use the same method used to make the payment (or, if the items have not yet been paid for, reflect the return of the items in your account balance) as soon as possible and at the latest within 14 days of receiving your notice of cancellation, provided we have received the items or evidence of you having sent back the items. Another payment method may be used for the refund, provided that you consent to such change; in any case this will not generate any additional charges.</p>

<ol start="6">
<li><strong> Returns<br /> </strong>Clément guarantees a full refund of the returned items in accordance with section 5 (Withdrawal of Order), provided that all items are returned in the same condition they were in upon your receipt. This means the items should not have been damaged, soiled, washed, altered or worn (other than to try the item on) and that any labels or tags should be intact.</li>
</ol>
<p>All our parcels contain a pre-printed return form for you to use if you decide to return any items. You will find more detailed information regarding our return process on the delivery note and in our  <a href="http://www2.vincentboscoart.com/en_gb/customer-service/return-link.html">Returns and Refund Policy</a>.</p>
<p>You can bring the item(s) you wish to return to any Clément or Clément Home store in the UK (excluding Clément outlets), provided that you bring your delivery note to the store. You will be refunded by the same payment method you used to make your purchase, in accordance with section 5.3 above. You can use your refunds for exchanges or new purchases directly in store if the purchase was made by credit card, Gift Card or a combination of the two. Faulty items may also be returned to any Clément or Clément Home store in the UK. Please note that incorrect orders (e.g. wrong or missing items), furniture and lighting cannot be returned to or handled by our stores.</p>
<p>Clément are happy to refund any Designer items within 3 days of delivery. This applies to items purchased both online and in store.</p>
<p>Please note that if our stores for some reason cannot access your online order, the return cannot be refunded with the same payment method that was used for the purchase, if you paid by any of the following payment methods; monthly instalment, pay next month, invoice or PayPal. In this case you have two options; you can either choose to return to Clément online or return your items in store. If you choose to return in store and have paid with any of the mentioned payment methods you will be refunded through a merchandise card. If you receive a merchandise card, you still must pay your outstanding invoice.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong> Payment methods<br /> </strong>You can pay for your goods in various ways as set out below.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Payment before delivery </strong></p>
<p><strong>Credit card or debit card</strong> <br /> You can enter your payment details at the time you place your order using a valid credit or debit card (VISA or Mastercard). The applicable amount will immediately be reserved on your card but will not be debited until the goods are dispatched. Clément reserves the right to check the validity of the credit or debit card, its credit status in relation to the order value and whether the address data of the purchaser is correct. We may refuse orders depending on the result of these checks.<br /> <strong><br /> PayPal<br /> </strong>When paying by PayPal, Clément reserves the right to check the validity of the PayPal account, that there are enough funds to cover the purchase sum and validate the billing address details of the purchaser. The applicable amount will immediately be reserved on your PayPal account but will not be debited until the goods are dispatched from the warehouse. Clément reserves the right to deny any purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Payment after delivery</strong></p>
<p><strong>Invoice - pay within 20 days</strong> <br /> The payment request is sent to your e-mail address when the order is shipped. The statement will show the total amount due including VAT and delivery charges. Payment is due within 20 days after the statement date.</p>
<p><strong>Pay next month</strong> <br /> All items you purchase and receive within one month are included in one statement, which is sent to you the following month. A fee of £1.25 will be added to the amount payable. Payment is due at the end of the month in which the statement is issued.</p>
<p><strong>Credit check</strong> <br /> Clément reserves the right to review your application for "invoice" and/or "pay next month" and to refuse it, limit it, demand an advance payment or suggest an alternative method of payment. We will review your credit history with credit and fraud prevention agencies when you apply for "invoice" and/or "pay next month" with us and, for any significant increase in your credit limit and periodically to manage your account. When a credit reference agency receives a search from us they will place a search footprint on your credit file that may be seen by other organizations. We will also share your personal data with credit reference agencies, fraud prevention agencies and other similar bodies in relation to the use of your account. The charges and rates of interest specified below may be varied from time to time by notice from Clément to you.</p>
<p><strong>Arrears</strong> <br /> You fall into arrears if your statement or instalment account is not paid by the due date. The total amount owed by you to Clément becomes payable immediately, or, in the case of customers paying by instalments, following notice from Clément to that effect. Clément will send you a payment reminder letter requesting payment immediately. If you have still failed to pay the overdue amounts Clément will send you a ”Notice of Default”. We will charge you £7.00 for each payment reminder letter and a further £12.00 for any Notice of Default. Clément reserves the right to charge an annual penalty interest of 17.9 % on the capital sum after due date if you choose "Pay next month" and an annual penalty interest of 17.9 % on the capital sum if you choose to pay in instalments. We will apply payments against the current debt in the following order: costs, interest and then capital sum. You always have a right to pay all or part of your instalment debt prior to a scheduled payment date.</p>
<p><strong>Others</strong> <br /> Please note that Clément reserves the right to send payment requests to your e-mail address.</p>
<p>Please note that we do not accept cash or cheques. If you wish to pay by cash/cheque please pay at your bank or a Barclays bank using your payment slip. Clément reserves the right to charge £15 for costs arising for any cash/cheques received.</p>
<p>You will receive the legally required invoice document in the Shipping Confirmation e-mail. </p>
